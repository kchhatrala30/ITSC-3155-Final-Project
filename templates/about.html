                <h2 class="text-center">What makes NUTT unique?</h2>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    What makes NUTT unique is the NUTT Map, which can be accessed under the "Maps" tab on our site.
                    The NUTT Map, with your permission, tracks your current location and
                    determines which building on campus you are closest to.
                    <br><br>
                    You may ask, what does our dear NUTT Map do with such trivial info?
                    After determining the building closest to you, NUTT Map will show you all the ratings tagged with that building,
                    so you know the cleanest spot to go!
                </p>
